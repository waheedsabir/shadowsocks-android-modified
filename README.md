## Shadowsocks Android Modified

This is a modified version of [shadowsocks-android](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-android) that removes ads, removes reliance on Google services and uses local modules to instead online service, removes TV modules, plug-ins, and simplifies proxy mode and related settings and data. It works well in china.

This app is currently in the stage of attempt open source, Plan to do 3 versions of the update and then evaluate to continue to open source. (If it is not open source then it will not be distributed.)
