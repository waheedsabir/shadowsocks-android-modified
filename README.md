## Shadowsocks Android Modified

This is a modified version of [shadowsocks-android](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-android) that removes ads, removes reliance on Google services and uses local modules to instead online service, removes TV modules, plug-ins, and simplifies proxy mode and related settings and data. It works well in china.
